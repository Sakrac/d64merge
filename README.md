# d64merge
Merge filenames from a 1541 data disk with a corresponding art disk. For use with lovingly crafted DirArt d64s to easily apply to d64 disks with boringly named files.

Usage:
d64merge.exe \<d64 data\> \<d64 dir\> \<d64 out\>

Notes:
* .d64 files all need different names
* .d64 dir should have more files than d64 data.
